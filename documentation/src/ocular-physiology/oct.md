3. Adapt chin rest
4. Instruction:
    1. “We will take X different images. For each image please focus either in the middle or at the green square.”

# Procedure pre-experiment data collection

## Corneal thickness  (pre-session)

1. Setup
    1. First put distance holder to forehead
    2. Select “ANTERIOR > Radial Anterior Seg.”
    3. Select “Color” → *no* Fundus photography
2. Get image
    1. Right image: 
        1. Horizontal line in the middle of the pupil and at pupil reflex
    2. Left image: 
        1. Horizontal line AND vertical line (light relex) should be in yellow square
3. Press button to take image

## Fundus photography (pre-session)

1. Setup
