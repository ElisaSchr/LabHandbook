# Github vscode tutorial

As you program on VSCode you might want to back it up on github

- To do so simply open the tab on the left of VSCode  and click on “publish to GitHub”

- Then you can rename the repository as you want to and chose whether it’s a public or private repository :

- Simply follow the procedure with the pop-ups from github.

Once you have selected which files you are about to push and commit to your private github repository, please head over to the .gitignore on the left-hand side and input the file formats to ignore

These specific file formats depending on the coding language can be found here : https://github.com/github/gitignore

- Once the ignored files are set, you can commit and push the files
- This process will add the files in your repository on GitHub

### Once this is done, you can commit new changes and preview them whenever you want it to

- Before committing new changes, add a message in the ‘message’ area on top of “commit” on the left-hand side of the VSCode tab
- If you don’t, a pop-up will show up, simply click “yes”

- Then state your message (1) and accept (2)

- The preview will be in red for the old version and green for the new updates
